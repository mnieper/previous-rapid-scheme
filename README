This repository contains an R7RS-compatible implementation of the Scheme
programming language in the Scheme programming language: The provided
implementation is a transpiler that takes an R7RS program and compiles it
into fully macro-expanded version with all referenced library code
loaded.

Prerequisites
-------------

  - Chibi Scheme: https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme

(Any other fully R7RS-compliant implementation of the Scheme programming
language should work as well when the necessary changes are made to the
provided shell scripts and make-files.)

Cloning
-------

This repository includes submodules. If you use the following clone command,
it will automatically initialize and update each submodule in the repository.

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mnieper/rapid-scheme.git

Run Tests
---------

You can run the tests by issuing:

  $ make check

Example
-------

  $ bin/rapid-scheme -Ishare examples/hello-world.scm > hello-world.bin
  $ chibi-scheme -Ilib hello-world.bin
  Hello, World!
  $ rm hello-world.bin

Bugs
----

The compiler is far from complete yet, contains bugs and the code is in
parts messy. However, it is complete enough so that it can successfully
compile itself:

  $ tests/meta-tests.sh
  $ echo $?
  0

(Note that this test takes quite a long time. Despite its name, the
current version of the compiler uses list-based data structures when
hash-tables or binary trees would be more appropiate. This will be
corrected later.)
